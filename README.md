# Google OAuth Demo in React Application

## Description

The Google OAuth Demo in React Application showcases the integration of Google OAuth authentication into a React web application. OAuth, which stands for Open Authorization, is a protocol that allows secure authorization between web applications. In this demo, we leverage Google's OAuth service to enable users to sign in to our React application using their Google credentials.

## Key Features

- **Google OAuth Integration**: Seamless integration of Google OAuth authentication, allowing users to sign in with their Google accounts.
  
- **React Application**: Built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture simplifies the development process and enhances code reusability.
  
- **Authentication Flow**: Initiate OAuth authentication flow by clicking on the "Sign In with Google" button, redirecting users to Google's authentication page.
  
- **Authorization**: Users are prompted to grant permission to the React application to access certain user data or perform specific actions on their behalf.
  
- **User Profile Retrieval**: Fetches the user's profile information from Google upon successful authentication and authorization, such as their name and email address.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a Google OAuth Client ID:

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.
   - Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.
   - Create credentials and select OAuth client ID.
   - Choose Web application.
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
   - Copy the generated Client ID.

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google OAuth Client ID:

   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
   ```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

6. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
